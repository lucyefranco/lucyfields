      <h4>wife</h4>
      <p>I met my husband when we both lived in Los Angeles in 2020, all thanks to the pandemic forcing me into online dating. We got married in July 2022 in a family friend's backyard, just 3 months after getting engaged on the Amalfi Coast in Italy. Pretty dreamy, right? Being married has been a masterclass in partnership and teamwork... and it helps when you're learning with your best friend.

      <h4>dog-mom</h4>
      <p>My little shadow... that's staring at me longingly as I type this, begging to be up on my lap. Don't worry, she's on my lap now. She's taught me great lessons in patience, forgiveness, and staying consistent... and that was just during potty training.</p>

      <h4>Utah transplant</h4>
      <p>When a promotion opportunity became available for my husband that required relocation to Salt Lake City, Utah, we made the calculated decision to pursue it. Luckily our calculations proved beneficial: as we were preparing to move out of the Bay Area, my previous employer announced layoffs and my position was affected. It's given me plenty of time to settle into our new space and explore the beauty of our new city. I am so incredibly proud of my husband and I love seeing him already thriving in this new role. </p>

      <div>
      <h4>career-changer</h4>
      <p>In my junior year of college, I stumbled upon an internship with a wedding coordinator and I thought that was it. Weddings (and/or events) to me seemed like they perfectly married my interests: connecting with people and solving puzzles. While you are building relationships with your client or vendors, you're also trying to figure out how the pieces of the event will fit together (timing, layout, etc.).
      <br></br>
      I spent about 5 years working at various levels in events before realizing, it wasn't what I wanted the rest of my career. The pandemic hit and of course being in events meant that I was furloughed. 
      <br></br>
      In the pursuit of making lemonade with the lemons life gave me, I reevaluted what I wanted out of my career and found myself enrolling in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program. It was a grueling 3-month bootcamp, but it proved to me that I can do anything I set my mind to. Shortly afterwards, I landed at Pariveda Solutions as a Software Developer Consultant, doing the same two things I did in events: solving puzzles and building relationships. I just had a different toolkit this time. </p>

      <h4>lifelong learner</h4>
      <p>If doing a coding bootcamp wasn't a dead giveaway, I should probably just say it: I like to learn and try new things. More recently I have been learning how to crochet and the Christmas gifts from me will never be the same. I also like attempting to cook new recipes for dinner, sometimes to my husband's delight... sometimes not. The thing about learning and trying something new is that even if you learn it's not your cup of tea, you still learned something about yourself.</p>
